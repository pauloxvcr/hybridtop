# Hybridtop

This repository contain a collection of algorithms that is useful for topology optimization.
The collection is composed by 3 Algorithms that was translate from Matlab to python [1-3] 
and a new algorithm that accomplish hybrid topology optimization based on the formulation proposed by 
Gaynor et al[4].

The 3 Softwares, PolyMesherpy, GRANDpy and PolyToppy, are for educational or academic use only. All rights of reproduction or
distribution in any form are reserved to the original creators.

The Matlab algorithms and the algorithms articles can be found in:

## Observations

Author of the translation and HybridTop code:

Paulo Vinicius Costa Rodrigues

The HybridTop algorithm was part of a master in civil engineering thesis oriented by Rejane Canha.

I thank the Capes financial agency for the support provided

My primary language is not english is portuguese (Brazil).

For now the algorithms do not follow the python convention, this made the job easier.

Some things I change the logic because a "literal" translation would not work.\n
Some comments is still in portuguese.
