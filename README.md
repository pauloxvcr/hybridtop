# hybridtop
This repository contain a collection of algorithms that is useful for topology optimization.
The collection is composed by 3 Algorithms that was translate from Matlab to python [1][2][3] 
and a new algorithm that accomplish hybrid topology optimization based on the formulation of 
Gaynor et al[4].
